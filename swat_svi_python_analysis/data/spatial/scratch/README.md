This is the README file for the scratch directory (swat_svi_python_anlysis > data > spatial > scratch) of the GitHub repository titled ['paper-yadkin-swat-svi-study'](https://github.com/sheilasaia/paper-yadkin-swat-svi-study). This directory is intentionally left blank because it is required to run some of the Python scripts in the scripts directory above. When these Python scripts are run, associated spatial data will be saved here.
