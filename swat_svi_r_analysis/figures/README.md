This is the README file for the figures directory (swat_svi_r_anlysis > figures) of the GitHub repository titled ['paper-yadkin-swat-svi-study'](https://github.com/sheilasaia/paper-yadkin-swat-svi-study). This directory is intentionally left blank because it is required to run some of the R scripts in the directory above. When these R scripts are run, associated figures will be saved here.
